# IFEM: Finite Element Method for Beam and Truss Elements

## Overview
The **IFEM** project provides a collection of **MATLAB scripts** implementing the **Finite Element Method (FEM)** for analyzing **beam and truss structures**. These scripts serve as an educational tool, helping users understand and apply FEM principles in structural engineering.

## Features
- **Beam Element Analysis**: Compute **deflections, rotations, bending moments, and shear forces** in beam structures under various loading conditions.
- **Truss Element Analysis**: Determine **axial forces, displacements, and reactions** in truss systems subjected to different loads.
- **Modular Code Structure**: Easily adapt and extend the code for **various structural analysis scenarios**.

## Requirements
- **MATLAB**: Ensure MATLAB is installed to run the scripts effectively.

## Getting Started
### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ashvar97/IFEM.git
```

### 2. Navigate to the Directory
```bash
cd IFEM/src
```

### 3. Run the Scripts
- **Open MATLAB**
- **Navigate to the `src` directory**
- **Execute the desired script**:
  ```matlab
  run('beam_analysis.m')
  ```

## Usage
### Beam Analysis
- **Define material properties, geometry, and loading conditions** in `beam_analysis.m`.
- **Run the script** to compute and visualize results.

### Truss Analysis
- **Specify node coordinates, connectivity, material properties, and loads** in `truss_analysis.m`.
- **Execute the script** to analyze truss behavior and display results.
